    <title>The Greedy Crow</title>

<body>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <strong>Once upon a time</strong> there was a fine <sup>pigeon</sup> who used to live on a nest close to a kitchen. The cooks of the kitchen <br> 
        used to like her very much and often used to feed her <sup>grain.</sup> She <b>liked</b> the place and her life was fine.
    </p>
    
        <h2>Crow Meet Pigeon </h2>
        <hr>
        <p><i>One day</i> a <sup>crow</sup>saw the <em>pigeon</em> and saw how it was getting wonderful food from the kitchen. Then <u>one day she  <br>
            made friendship with the pigeon</u>, and under the pretext of friendship, she somehow made the pigeon to <br>
            share the nest with the crow. <br><br>
            The <i>pigeon</i> then told her that they could spend time together discussing <u>politics,</u><br>
           <u>religion etc</u> but when it <br>
            came to <em>food</em> both had their own ways. <br><br>
            So she suggested the crow to search for her own food.
        </p> 

        <h2>Impatient Crow</h2> <hr>
       <p>But the crow was <i>impatient</i> and the very reason she had made friends with the pigeon was for the <b>food.</b> The crow <br>
        wanted <sup>meat</sup> and all the pigeon got was <sub>grains</sub> from the kitchen. <br><br>
        It could not wait any longer and ultimately decided that <i>she visit the kitchen directly for the food.</i> <br><br>

        Thinking so, it stealthily crept down the chimney into the kitchen. She got the smell of a fish being curried on <br>
        the pan. She got greedy and went ahead and tried to get the fish. But in the process she disturbed a ladle, and <br>
        created a noise. This alerted the cook who was in the neighboring room and he caught hold of the crow <br>
        and <del>killed it.</del>
